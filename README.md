Calculator webapp Using Php
We are using here php as a backend language 
php is very efficient backend language it hides the complete logic of any program from the user and only gives required output to the user it

php is dynamically typed language here we donot need to specify whether the given declared variable is integer,character or any string 

php is not a case sensitive language

function => var dump() returns type and value of variable

logical operator => 
and(&&) ,or(||) ,xor ,!(not)

data type =>
string, integer, float, boolean, array, object

define('PI',3.14); this is syntax of setting any constant in the php here PI is constant of value 3.14
